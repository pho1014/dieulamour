This blog will be used to keep track of my journey of learning to make VR games/applications with the following areas in focus:

1.) Blender modelling/rigging/animation  
2.) UE 4  
3.) General analysis/review of existing VR titles  

This will also serve as a devlog for my project: Apples & Butterflies. Which will involve basic animated characters, controller interactions and particle effects.  

Here's something I made in blender a while ago.
